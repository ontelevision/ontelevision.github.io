Weston&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;a familiar face
from &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2191671/"&gt;Elementary&lt;/a&gt; (7.9 IMDb)

Houdini&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4428734/"&gt;Rebecca
Liddiard&lt;/a&gt; as Adelaide Stratton,
whom I don't recognize from her past work, but am impressed with her
work on this show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houdini and Doyle is reminiscent of a few notable UK programs: in
particular, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2183641/"&gt;Ripper Street&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/"&gt;Sherlock&lt;/a&gt;. It borrows the look
and feel of Ripper Street and attempts to match the comedy found in
Sherlock. It succeeds getting the first, and provides a great example
of consume and set design, as well as location
scouting. Unfortunately, Houdini and Doyle fumbles styling it's comedy
after that of Sherlock. Don't get me wrong, it's not entirely lacking
in humor, but the general effect of the humor is a smile, not a
laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central theme of the show questions&amp;mdash;or more precisely,
attempts to refute&amp;mdash;the validity of supernatural events. An
ongoing debate between the main characters involves not only whether
or not the supernatural exists, but whether or not it interferes with
the affairs of the police. In this, the show plays off the viewers
assumptions about the characters: Doyle penned the likes of Sherlock
Holmes, a clinically&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;cynically&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;logical character, if
ever there was one; while Houdini, himself, was a life-long
illusionist and mystic. It might then come as a surprise that Doyle is
feverishly invested in finding signs of the supernatural, while
Houdini is convinced, in every instance, that there exists a better,
more &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt;, explanation of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the people they portray were a product of their time: no
more liable to question the efficacy of a mercury treatment than many
of us question a friend's trip to the chiropractor. The roles they
play in the show are acutely exaggerated. Houdini's unshakable
skepticism is anachronistic and disappointing; it belabors the theme
and paints the character in to a single contrarian corner. Doyle, on
the other hand, being the proponent of the preposterous comes across
as the, albeit a naive, curious optimists. These traits still hold
true after the seemingly supernatural events have been properly
attributed to real causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later find that Doyle's search for the supernatural is not without
its motive, despite not being well reasoned. His fixation can be
traced to his wife's bedridden battle with tuberculosis. She is
revealed to be in a coma, without hope of recovery. Doyle's obsession
with the supernatural might be more sympathetically framed as a
struggle with helplessness and difficulty with the frailty of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houdini and Doyle falls in to the category of shows that are, in
general, entertaining, but not challenging or genre-shattering
watches. I can't say I would go out of my way to recommend the show to
a serious audience, unless they were looking for something mindless
and easy. That said, if you find yourself having a sleepless night, or
wanting to simply zone-out, then it may be worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Comedy"></category><category term="Mystery"></category><category term="UK"></category></entry><entry><title>City of Men</title><link href="http://ontelevision.github.io/2016/city-of-men.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-03-31T05:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Ben Burnett</name></author><id>tag:ontelevision.github.io,2016-03-31:2016/city-of-men.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870090/"&gt;City of Men&lt;/a&gt; (7.3 IMDb)&amp;mdash;a

God&lt;/a&gt; (8.7 IMDb)&amp;mdash;follows
the lives of two friends, Acerola and Laranjinha, in the streets of
Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show opens with one of the main characters running in place as a
sequence of hand drawn buildings coast by. The credits are work that
only a fledgling film student could be proud of. But don't let it turn
you off; the opening credits do not reflect the production of the rest
of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show itself is fast-paced and features a fast-spoken jumble of
Portuguese. The speed at which the lines are delivered can make it
difficult to follow the dialog; but, despite this, it is worth hanging
in there. The show offers compelling characters and it is packed full
of talented actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We join the duo, Acerola and Laranjinha, on the morning of a school
day, in a lecture on Napoleonic history. The class is a pandemonious
mess of noise, unanswered questions and an instructor determined to
cruises through the day's material. The tumultuous nature of the
class, it seems, is intended to mirror the chaos of an ongoing war
between local gangs that injects itself later in the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In class, a field trip to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Museum_of_Brazil"&gt;Imperial Museum of
Brazil&lt;/a&gt; is
scheduled for the next day. During the trip, students are to see the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Crown_of_Brazil"&gt;Diamantine
Crown&lt;/a&gt;, a
precious left-over of the monarchy that once ruled Brazil. Not keen on
being left out, the boys rush off to hustle their passage on the
excursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera is not shy of darting around as the characters scurry in
the streets, busily going about their work. It closely follows our
protagonists as they make their way to their first marks. A
grandmother and&amp;mdash;what we can only assume to be a lover to one of
the character's mothers&amp;mdash;take the bait, and provide the boys with
requisite liquidity for the next day's tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one of the boys is robbed on the morning of the trip, the other
offers to help: they put together a scheme to ask one of the drug
lords for money. The rub: the plan involves blaming the lord's rival
for the robbery&amp;mdash;from which a shoot-out with a gruesome and
tragic end is spawned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acerola and Laranjinha face a neighborhood&amp;mdash;and a city&amp;mdash;torn
by hate, crime, and lives lived on the fringe of civility. Theirs is a
life that only a scant few of us can related to. A view through this
lens provides a small glimpse in to a foreign world, with both it's
beauty and harshness exposed... That said, it's well worth taking a
look.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Brazil"></category><category term="Crime"></category><category term="Drama"></category></entry></feed>
