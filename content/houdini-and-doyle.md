from [Elementary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2191671/) (7.9 IMDb)
among other works&mdash;as [Harry
Houdini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Houdini); and [Rebecca
Liddiard](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4428734/) as Adelaide Stratton,
whom I don't recognize from her past work, but am impressed with her
work on this show.

Houdini and Doyle is reminiscent of a few notable UK programs: in
particular, [Ripper Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2183641/) and
[Sherlock](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/). It borrows the look
and feel of Ripper Street and attempts to match the comedy found in
Sherlock. It succeeds getting the first, and provides a great example
of consume and set design, as well as location
scouting. Unfortunately, Houdini and Doyle fumbles styling it's comedy
after that of Sherlock. Don't get me wrong, it's not entirely lacking
in humor, but the general effect of the humor is a smile, not a
laugh.

The central theme of the show questions&mdash;or more precisely,
attempts to refute&mdash;the validity of supernatural events. An
ongoing debate between the main characters involves not only whether
or not the supernatural exists, but whether or not it interferes with
the affairs of the police. In this, the show plays off the viewers
assumptions about the characters: Doyle penned the likes of Sherlock
Holmes, a clinically&mdash;_cynically_&mdash;logical character, if
ever there was one; while Houdini, himself, was a life-long
illusionist and mystic. It might then come as a surprise that Doyle is
feverishly invested in finding signs of the supernatural, while
Houdini is convinced, in every instance, that there exists a better,
more _logical_, explanation of events.

In reality, the people they portray were a product of their time: no
more liable to question the efficacy of a mercury treatment than many
of us question a friend's trip to the chiropractor. The roles they
play in the show are acutely exaggerated. Houdini's unshakable
skepticism is anachronistic and disappointing; it belabors the theme
and paints the character in to a single contrarian corner. Doyle, on
the other hand, being the proponent of the preposterous comes across
as the, albeit a naive, curious optimists. These traits still hold
true after the seemingly supernatural events have been properly
attributed to real causes.

We later find that Doyle's search for the supernatural is not without
its motive, despite not being well reasoned. His fixation can be
traced to his wife's bedridden battle with tuberculosis. She is
revealed to be in a coma, without hope of recovery. Doyle's obsession
with the supernatural might be more sympathetically framed as a
struggle with helplessness and difficulty with the frailty of life.

Houdini and Doyle falls in to the category of shows that are, in
general, entertaining, but not challenging or genre-shattering
watches. I can't say I would go out of my way to recommend the show to
a serious audience, unless they were looking for something mindless
and easy. That said, if you find yourself having a sleepless night, or
wanting to simply zone-out, then it may be worth a watch.
